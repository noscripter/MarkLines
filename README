The MarkLines plugin allows one to visually mark any number of lines, in any
number of buffers, with any chosen highlight.  In a sufficiently new version
of VIM, 7.1.040 or greater, you can use more than one highlight color per
window simultaneously.

THIS PLUGIN REQUIRES VIM 7.0 OR GREATER.

Useful for things like 'Mark every line that contains the word...'  or
'Brighten every line containing a function declaration' without having it
cleared every time you search for something else.  :)

(By the way, you could do the first example with :%g/foo/MarkLinesOn)

:MarkLinesOn         turns on highlighting for the current line or range
:MarkLinesOff         turns off highlighting for the current line or range
:MarkLinesToggle  toggles highlighting for the current line or range

Each can be followed by an optional highlight group name as an argument;
if so they turn on highlighting to that color (On, Toggle) or only clear lines of
that color (Off).

A few maps are provided as well.
<leader>mc   Clear:  Call MarkLinesOff for the current line or selection.
<leader>ms   Select: Call MarkLinesOn for the current line or selection.
<leader>mt   Toggle: Call MarkLinesToggle for the current line or selection.
<leader>me   Error:  Like \mt but using the "ErrorMsg" group, rather than the
                     default highlight group.

For more details please see the in-vim help.  I spent a long time writing it,
someone should read it.  ^_^

Any questions, please feel free to email me.
